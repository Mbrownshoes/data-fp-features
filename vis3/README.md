BC Data Catalogue Records by Organization Visualization
==================================================


This data visualization was built to support the exploration of  [DataBC's Catalogue records by Organization data ](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-data-catalogue-content). This dataset and many more are available through the provincial [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/).

This visualization accesses the data directly via the Data Catalogue's [CKAN Datastore API](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/api/action/datastore_search?resource_id=bca62da0-936b-450d-a8a8-7b70231aa225&limit=5). Here you can learn more about leveraging the:[CKAN API](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html) and the [CKAN Data Store API](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/datastore.html#the-datastore-api).

Both the code that produces this data visualization, and the code that presents the visualizations and page elements of  [data.gov.bc.ca](http://data.gov.bc.ca) are available under the Apache / MIT license.

The code that powers the BC Data Catalogue is also available here [https://github.com/bcgov/ckanext-bcgov](https://github.com/bcgov/ckanext-bcgov) .
